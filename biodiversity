# proportionally, mammals and amphibians are overrepresented among least-seen species as compared to their proportion of all observations

# The most interesting finding is that, although it is a species in recovery, the gray wolf is still rarely seen (number of observations on par with endangered species) in all four parks.
# Another interesting finding is that, proportionally, mammals and amphibians are overrepresented among "least-observed" species at Yellowstone.
# Additionally, no observations of nonvascular plants were recorded at Yellowstone.
